        <h1>IQRSlide Privacy Policy</h1>
        <p class="last-updated">Last updated: 2025-01-XX</p>
        
        <div class="intro">
            <p>IQRSlide ("the App") is developed and operated by Teo Ying Chieh ("we", "us"). This policy explains how we handle user data when you use the App.</p>
        </div>

        <h2>1. Information We Collect</h2>
        
        <h3>1.1 Local Data (Stored on Your Device Only)</h3>
        <ul>
            <li><strong>Photos chosen by the user:</strong> You may capture images with the device camera or pick from the gallery to create puzzles. These images stay on the device and are not uploaded to our servers unless you choose to use the Cloud Challenge feature (see section 1.2).</li>
            <li><strong>Gameplay records:</strong> The App keeps local records such as completion time, number of moves, selected difficulty, and an optional thumbnail generated from the chosen photo. These records remain on your device unless you delete them.</li>
        </ul>

        <h3>1.2 Cloud Challenge Feature (Optional)</h3>
        <p>If you choose to use the Cloud Challenge feature to share puzzles with friends, we collect and temporarily store the following data on Firebase Storage (Google Cloud):</p>
        <ul>
            <li><strong>Photos:</strong> The puzzle image you select, resized to a standard format (maximum 2560x1440 pixels for landscape or 1440x2560 pixels for portrait), compressed as JPEG.</li>
            <li><strong>Game configuration data:</strong> Including difficulty level, puzzle arrangement, and timestamps.</li>
            <li><strong>Anonymous user identifier:</strong> Firebase Authentication generates an anonymous user ID to associate uploaded challenges with your device. This ID does not contain personal information such as your name or email address.</li>
        </ul>
        
        <div class="highlight">
            <p><strong>Important:</strong> Cloud Challenge is an optional feature. You can use the App fully without uploading any data to our servers. All uploaded challenge data is automatically deleted from Firebase Storage after 1 day.</p>
        </div>

        <h3>1.3 Advertising and Analytics</h3>
        <ul>
            <li><strong>Device information from Google AdMob:</strong> When ads are enabled, Google AdMob may automatically collect device identifiers (including advertising ID), approximate location, usage data, and diagnostic information in accordance with Google's policies.</li>
            <li><strong>Rewarded ads:</strong> To earn upload opportunities for Cloud Challenges, you may choose to watch rewarded ads. AdMob collects data as described in Google's Privacy Policy.</li>
        </ul>

        <h2>2. How We Use Information</h2>
        <ul>
            <li><strong>Core gameplay features:</strong> Generate puzzles, save records locally, and allow you to replay with previously used photos.</li>
            <li><strong>Cloud Challenge feature (optional):</strong> Enable you to create and share puzzle challenges with friends via a temporary 6-digit code. Uploaded data is stored temporarily and automatically deleted after 1 day.</li>
            <li><strong>Display in-app advertising:</strong> Via Google AdMob (test ads during development; production release may use live ads).</li>
            <li><strong>Account management:</strong> Firebase Anonymous Authentication is used solely to manage access to the Cloud Challenge feature. No personal information is collected or stored.</li>
            <li><strong>Improve stability and user experience:</strong> For example, storing your last-used difficulty setting locally.</li>
        </ul>

        <h2>3. Data Storage and Retention</h2>
        
        <h3>3.1 Local Data</h3>
        <ul>
            <li>All gameplay records and thumbnails are stored only on your device's internal storage.</li>
            <li>If you tap "Clear" in the records screen or uninstall the App, the stored records and thumbnails are deleted.</li>
            <li>We do not maintain external backups or cloud copies of your local data.</li>
        </ul>

        <h3>3.2 Cloud Challenge Data</h3>
        <ul>
            <li><strong>Storage location:</strong> Uploaded challenge data (photos and configuration) is stored on Firebase Storage (Google Cloud Platform).</li>
            <li><strong>Retention period:</strong> All uploaded challenge data is automatically deleted after 1 day (24 hours) from the time of upload.</li>
            <li><strong>Automatic deletion:</strong> We use Google Cloud Storage Lifecycle Rules to ensure automatic deletion. You do not need to take any action.</li>
            <li><strong>No permanent storage:</strong> We do not maintain permanent copies of your uploaded challenge data.</li>
        </ul>

        <h3>3.3 Anonymous User IDs</h3>
        <ul>
            <li>Firebase Anonymous Authentication generates a unique anonymous identifier for your device when you first use the Cloud Challenge feature.</li>
            <li>This identifier is used only to associate uploaded challenges with your device and is not linked to any personal information.</li>
            <li>The identifier persists until you uninstall the App or clear the App's data.</li>
        </ul>
